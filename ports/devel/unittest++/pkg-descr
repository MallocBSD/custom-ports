UnitTest++ is a lightweight unit testing framework for C++. It was designed
to do test-driven development on a wide variety of platforms. Simplicity,
portability, speed, and small footprint are all very important aspects of
UnitTest++. UnitTest++ is ANSI portable C++ and makes minimal use of advanced
library and languages features, which means it should be easily portable to
just about any platform.
