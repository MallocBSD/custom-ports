New low-level system programming language that is designed to interoperate
seamlessly with the Lua programming language. It is also backwards compatible
with (and embeddable in) existing C code. Like C, Terra is a monomorphic,
statically-typed, compiled language with manual memory management. But unlike
C, it is designed to make interaction with Lua easy. Terra code shares Lua's
syntax and control-flow constructs. It is easy to call Lua functions from
Terra (or Terra functions from Lua).
